## Jet Project (third java project)

### Overview

For this project I wrote a program that can take input from the user and view info about various Jets, add a jet to the fleet, and remove a jet from the fleet.I defined a Jets class with a Fighter Jet and Cargo Jet class that extend the Jet class and Implement various actions. There is an airfield that holds the jets and allows users to add or delete jets.
I created a separate class with a main method that starts the program.  The main method of this class is the only static method in the entire project.

### Topics
* Taking user input to create objects in a separate class
* Used non static methods
* Created an ArrayList
* Used information from the ArrayList
* Extended class and used Implementations

### How to Run
Step 1. Input what you would like to do first.

Step 2. Input what you would like to do next.

Step 3. Follow the onscreen instructions for adding and deleting a jet.
